    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        
        <li>Rinse 250 grams spinach leaves very well in running water. Once they are rinsed, place them in a colander, so that the excess water drains off.</li>
        <li>Boil 3 cups water in a pan. You can also boil water in an electric heater and then take it in a pan or bowl.</li>
        <li>Add the spinach leaves in the water. Mix to combine and immerser the leaves in the water. Blanch the spinach leaves in water for 3 minutes.</li>
        <li>When the spinach leaves are blanching, in another bowl, take 2 cups some water and add 8 to 10 ice cubes.</li>
        <li>After 3 minutes, remove the blanched spinach leaves from the hot water and add them to the cold water. Stir gently so that all the leaves are immersed in the cold water.</li>
        <li>Place the spinach leaves in a grinder or blender jar.</li>
        <li>Grind or blend to a smooth puree. No need to add any water while grinding or blending. If you prefer you can also blend the blanched spinach leaves to a slightly coarser puree.</li>
        <li>This step is optional but recommended as lightly golden pan-fried paneer cubes taste good. Heat 3 tablespoons oil in a well-seasoned pan or non-stick pan. Place the paneer cubes (250 grams).</li>
        <li>Turn over when one side is lightly golden and fry the other side.</li>
        <li>Fry till the paneer cubes are light golden evenly. Avoid frying too much or for a longer time, as then the paneer cubes become dense.</li>
        <li>Remove and then drain the fried paneer cubes on kitchen paper towels.</li>
        <li>To soften the paneer more, keep them immediately in water. Let the paneer to be in the water for 3 to 4 minutes. Then lightly squeeze them and keep aside.</li>
        <li>Now in the same oil, in which we had pan-fried paneer, add the following spices – ½ teaspoon cumin seeds and 2 small tej patta or 1 medium to large tej patta (Indian bay leaf). Fry till the cumin splutters.</li>
        <li>Then add ⅓ cup finely chopped onions.</li>
        <li>Stir well. Sauté the onions till they turn light golden on medium-low to medium heat.</li>
        <li>Then add 1 teaspoon ginger paste, 1 teaspoon garlic paste and 1 to 1.5 teaspoon finely chopped green chilies.</li>
        <li>Stir and sauté till the raw aroma of ginger-garlic goes away.</li>
        <li>Now add the ground spices and herbs:
            1 pinch of turmeric powder
            ½ teaspoon black pepper, crushed in a mortar-pestle, optional</li>
        <li>Stir and mix well.</li>
        <li>Add the spinach puree.</li>
        <li>Season with salt according to your taste preferences.</li>
        <li>Add in a pinch of sugar. Stir and mix.</li>
        <li>On a low to medium heat, for about 6 to 7 minutes, simmer the gravy till it slightly thickens.</li>
        <li>Add ¼ cup light cream or low-fat cream (or 2 to 3 tablespoons whipping cream) and ½ teaspoon garam masala powder.</li>
        <li>Stir to combine to an even mix. The cream should be mixed very well with the palak sauce or gravy. Then switch off the heat.</li>
        <li>Add the paneer cubes.</li>
        <li>Mix them well with the rest of the gravy. Cover the pan and set aside.</li>
        <li>This is an optional step, but I highly recommend it. Burn a small piece of natural charcoal on a stovetop with the help of tongs.</li>
        <li>Now place a small bowl or some layers of an onion in the gravy. Place the charcoal on top.</li>
        <li>As soon as the smoke begins to emit, immediately cover the pan tightly with a lid. Keep the pan covered for a minute so that the charcoal’s smoky aroma and flavor gets infused with the dish.</li>
        <li>Serve restaurant style palak paneer with tandoori roti, naan, chapati, paratha or cumin rice or saffron rice. The lightly spiced spinach sauce or gravy also pairs well with steamed rice.</li>
